Title: Insights from My Summer Assignments on Machine Learning

During this summer, I had the opportunity to dive deep into machine learning algorithms as part of my PhD work. I explored both continuous data prediction and classification algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machines (SVM), CatBoost, XGBoost, Random Forest, and more.

Some key takeaways:

For regression tasks: XGBoost and CatBoost showed superior performance in capturing complex non-linear relationships.
For classification tasks: XGBoost and Random Forest were nearly perfect in terms of accuracy and recall, especially in highly imbalanced datasets.
If you're interested in learning more or checking out the details of my findings, you can explore my full report and the corresponding code on GitHub. The link to the repository is below.

I hope these insights are helpful to those of you working in data science and machine learning! Feel free to explore the code, and Iâ€™d be happy to discuss or answer any questions.
